Swapping Technique Example:

Let us assume that the user process is of size 
2048KB and on a standard hard disk where swapping 
will take place has a data transfer rate around 
1 MB per second. The actual transfer of the 1000K 
process to or from memory will take

2048KB / 1024KB per second
= 2 seconds
= 2000 milliseconds
Now considering in and out time, it will take 
complete 4000 milliseconds plus other overhead 
where the process competes to regain main memory.

demo:

start 1 terminal type:
top

start 2 terminal type:
nano leak.c

cat leak.c


   type:
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
int main(int argc, char ** argv)
{
        while(1){
                malloc(512 * 1024);
                printf("leaked !! \n");
        }
        return 0;
}
